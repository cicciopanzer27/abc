Initial commit: Complete Borel-IUT Lean 4 framework

This commit establishes the complete framework for formalizing the Borel-IUT
correspondence in Lean 4, providing mechanical verification of the results
presented in the paper "Spectral Decoupling and Borel Structure in 
Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory".

Components added:
- Core Frobenioid category structure (Basic.lean, Decomposition.lean)
- Borel subgroup definitions with mathlib4 integration (Definition.lean)
- Spectral decoupling theorem (SpectralDecoupling.lean)
- Frobenioid-Borel correspondence theorem (Correspondence/Main.lean)
- Error bounds for height calculations (Height/ErrorBounds.lean)
- Perfectoid-Borel compatibility lemma (Perfectoid/BorelCompatibility.lean)
- Computational examples (Examples/Correlation.lean)
- Test framework (Tests/BorelStructure.lean)
- CI/CD configuration with GitHub Actions
- Complete documentation (README.md, SETUP.md, CATALOG.md)

All theorems are structured with proper Lean 4 syntax, using `sorry` for
proofs that will be completed incrementally. The framework is ready for
development and collaboration.
